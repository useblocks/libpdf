# The texts inside tables shall not be LTTextBoxes. Instead, they shall be extracted by the page crop on the cell.
# In this case, all of the LTTextBoxes inside tables shall be either ignored or removed. However, Some LTTextboxes

# introduced to expand the coverages of tables to make sure the LTTextboxes inside the tables can all be found.
# The value here is defined by experiences. It can differ in different kinds of PDF layouts. Machine learning may be
# a good solution to decide the value in the further.

HEADER_FOOTER_OCCURRENCE_PERCENTAGE = 0.3

# A real header/footer element has two attributes:
# - continuously occurs from page to page
# - same y0 coordinate for header/footer
# However some PDFs do not strictly follow this, that's why the following 3 parameters exist.
# They are used for smart header/footer detection to filter out falsely detected header/footer elements.
# The followed parameters are given in percentage (range 0..1):
# 1. the page missing header or footer percentage means, The maximal percentage of pages on which no header or footer
#    elements at all, e.g detected header or footer elements on page 2-20 except page 5 and page 9, cause on page 5 and
#    9, there are no header or footer elements at all, this is inside the 15% tolerance. This parameter is needed to
#    make sure the gap (page missing header or footer elements) is in tolerance before using the second parameter
#    HEADER_FOOTER_CONTINUOUS_PERCENTAGE in below to check the continuous
# 2. the header or footer element continuous percentage, used to check continuousness of detected header or footer
#    element, e.g. for pdf with only 4 pages, chapter headline on page 1 and page 3 are very close to header, they
#    appear on more than 30% of pdf pages, but they are not continuous. To check the continuousness of detected
#    potential header or footer element, this parameter HEADER_FOOTER_CONTINUOUS_PERCENTAGE is used, e.g. for the 4
#    pages pdf, detected potential header element: chapter headline, start page is 1, end page is 3, 3*0.8 = 2.4, which
#    means the detected potential header element should appear on more than 2.4 pages, but it only appears on page 1 and
#    3, so it's not header element
# 3. the unique header or footer elements is used for some pdfs, they have header or footer elements that are only
#    partially continuous, e.g. one detected header element appears on page 2-10, 20-30, 50-60, another detected header
#    element appears on page 2-60, these two detected elements are actually header elements, but the second parameter
#    HEADER_FOOTER_CONTINUOUS_PERCENTAGE will detect the element (appear on page 2-10, 20-30, 50-60) not as header
#    element. In order to solve this partially continuous header or footer element situation, this third parameter is
#    introduced, inside each header or footer on each page, they can have several elements with several unique y0
#    position, and they should be consistent though the whole pdf, hence, we check the amounts of unique header
#    elements. This parameter UNIQUE_HEADER_OR_FOOTER_ELEMENTS_PERCENTAGE is given in percentage, e.g. for the above
#    example, detected potential header element that appear on page 2-10, 20-30, 50-60, the maximal unique header
#    elements shall be 60*0.05 = 3, for small pdf, like only 4 pages, 4*0.05 = 0.2, which is smaller than 1, so the
#    minimal is 1. In a word, the unique header or footer element for the whole pdf should in range:
